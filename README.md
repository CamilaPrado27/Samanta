# Final Project  - Plant Pot Monitoring with Sensors ðŸŒ±

This project aims to monitor humidity, light, and temperature data in a plant pot with integrated sensors.
The collected information is displayed in a web interface, built with *React.js* on the frontend and *Node.js* on the backend.

## Getting Started
To run the server and view the sensor data, follow the steps below:

### Install Dependencies

npm install
```

### Start the Server

```bash

The frontend application will be available at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), 
and the backend application will be available at [localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).
